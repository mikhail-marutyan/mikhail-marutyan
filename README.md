# Hi, I’m Mikhail!
**DocOps Engineer & Technical Writer**

## What I do

- Build multi-repo, single‑source documentation infrastructure with QA & security automation.  
- Design and implement end-to-end docs-as-code development cycles (upstream/downstream flows, Git workflows, shift-left integration).
- Implement documentation health metrics, logging, and dashboards with Prometheus/Grafana.
- Drive continuous localization pipelines (i18n/l10n automation).
- Develop competency frameworks, hiring workflows, and onboarding programs for technical documentation teams.  
- Mentor and consult on documentation architecture, process governance, and documentation-oriented DevOps practices.

## Currently exploring

- AI-powered documentation bots and assistants.
- AI-driven documentation linting and QA (style guide enforcement, API linting).
- AI documentation generation and summarization (natural‑language generation from codebases based on templates).
