**DocOps Engineer & Technical Writer**

## What I do

- Build multi-repo, single‑source documentation infrastructure with CI/CD pipelines and QA/security automation.  
- Design and implement docs‑as‑code workflows: upstream/downstream processes, GitFlow, shift‑left integration.  
- Drive continuous localization pipelines with gettext/POT, Git hooks and TMs.  
- Develop competency frameworks, hiring workflows, and onboarding programs for technical documentation teams.  
- Mentor and consult on documentation architecture, process governance, and documentation-oriented DevOps practices.

## Currently learning

- AI documentation generation and summarization (natural‑language generation from codebases based on templates).
